# Software-Test-Automation-Quality-Assurance

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I will follow coding best practices and procedures, including comments to the code to notate the functionality, and follow what I have learned for quality assurance and testing to ensure it passes errors correctly. Ensuring I follow these steps will also ensure I am maintaining functional software and security constraints. I will also make certain I follow ethical coding, and know what I am working on from start to finish so that I don't create something with detrimental use towards others.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by asking questions, and if there is something I need to better define, i can ask for clarification. Knowing what users want out of my work can help me incorporate the necessary changes to my work and ensure I am creating a functional branch into a program.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I approach designing software by first knowing what requirements are needed in the software. It helps to know what I am working on and what functions are required, who needs to access these functions, how the functions are supposed to interact with eachother, and what the goal of the software is meant to touch on.
